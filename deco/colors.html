            color palettes are generally divided into two sets of colors: primary and secondary. The primary colors are generally the more dominant colors in the site, accounting for background colors, logo colors, menu colors, etc., and secondary colors are often used as accent colors, among other use cases. Very often, youâ€™ll also see that a color palette will include several shades of the same color, which gives the website a varied yet consistent feeling throughout its design.
